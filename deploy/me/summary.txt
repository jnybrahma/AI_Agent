My name is Jnyananjoy Brahma. I'm an electrical , control system and software developer. I'm originally from India, but I moved to Australia in 2006.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
